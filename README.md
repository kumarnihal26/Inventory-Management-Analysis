# Inventory Management & Demand Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project analyzes inventory and sales data to help optimize stock levels
and forecast future demand.

## Dataset
Daily sales and inventory data for multiple products in different stores.
A sample dataset is included due to size limitations.

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory analysis (units sold, inventory levels, high/low demand products)
3. Demand forecasting using 7-day moving average
4. Visualization of sales trends and inventory

## Key Insights
- High-demand products identified for restocking priority
- Average inventory per product calculated to prevent stockouts
- Simple forecast provides actionable insights for inventory planning

## Future Enhancements
- Implement ARIMA/Prophet for more accurate forecasting
- Include promotions, holidays, and competitor pricing in forecast
- Build interactive dashboards using Power BI / Tableau
